# MPC (Model Predictive Control)
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


## Goal

The goal of the project is to implement Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track using simple kinematic model.

## Model

THe project is based on the simple kinematic model.  The vehicle state in kinematic model include for parameters [x,y,ψ,v]
x - x coordinate of the vehicle
y - y coordinate of the vehicle 
ψ - orientation angle
v - speed


## Paramertes Tuning

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

## Latency
