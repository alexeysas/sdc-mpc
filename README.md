## Goal

The goal of the project is to implement Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track using simple kinematic model.

## Model

The project is based on the simple kinematic model.  The vehicle state in kinematic model include for parameters [x,y,ψ,v]

x - x coordinate of the vehicle

y - y coordinate of the vehicle 

ψ - orientation angle

v - speed

Following eequazions determine state transition for the simple kinematic model:

Where addtional parameters are:

L_f -  measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity. The larger the vehicle, the slower the turn rate.
